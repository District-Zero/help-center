# Completing Check-ins

Regular check-ins are a crucial part of your mentorship journey. They help you reflect on your progress, identify areas for improvement, and maintain consistent communication with your mentor.

## Check-in Process

1. Log in to your DistrictZero account
2. Navigate to the "Check-ins" section
3. Select "New Check-in"
4. Complete the provided questionnaire
5. Reflect on your recent experiences and EI growth
6. Submit your check-in

## Best Practices

- Be honest and thorough in your responses
- Use specific examples to illustrate your points
- Identify both successes and challenges
- Consider how you've applied EI competencies in recent situations

## Frequency

Aim to complete a check-in at least once a week, or as often as recommended by your mentor or program administrator.

Remember, consistent check-ins lead to more meaningful mentorship experiences and faster EI growth.
